# TempleRun 
### 3D arcade game in OpenGL

The goal of this project was to create a 3D arcade game looking like TEMPLE RUN using the OpenGL library.

## Compile and launch the game

install dependencies : 

`sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-0 libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-mixer1.2 libsdl-mixer1.2-dev`

To compile the game and the libreries, use the `CMakeLists` file in a build folder:
```
cd build
cmake ../
```
Then, use the `makefile` to compile :
```
make
```

Finally, to start the game, simply run the command:
```
./bin/Temple_Run
```
